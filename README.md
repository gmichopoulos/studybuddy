StudyBuddy
==========
StudyBuddy was developed as a final project for CS147, Human-Computer Interaction, by George Michopoulos, Shilpa Apte, and Dan Schwartz.
Dan designed the logo and was in charge of design, George coded the PHP back-end and set up the database, and George and Shilpa coded the front-end utilizing jQuery mobile, the Facebook API, and the Google Maps API.
The app itself was only designed as a demo, and has limited functionality complete.
